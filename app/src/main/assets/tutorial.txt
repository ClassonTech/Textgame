*grumble grumble* oh boy am I hungry! I hope there's breakfast waiting for me downstairs
@<012>
Lets Go!
##012
Walk down the stairs 
Mom: Good morning, my child! I hope you had a good night’s sleep.
Today’s a big day for you I know, but I didn’t have time to make you breakfast,
me and your father have to go into town today.
@<014>
“Didn’t sleep at all.”
##014
Actually, mom, I’m really nervous about what’s going to happen today.
I didn’t even get any sleep, and I have no idea what I’m gonna do
with the rest of my life, yet in like, an hour I have to choose.
Mom: well, don’t worry, just pick something you enjoy, and I’m sure you’ll be happy.
Dad: Ha Ha Ha! I’m sure your choice will bring honor to our family,
you’ve got my warrior  bloo-- Ow!! What was that for!?
Mom: Like I said, just be happy! 
@<015>
Silence
##015
mmmm…
Dad: Jeez, who pooped on his pancakes?
Mom: Oh let him be! he has a big decision to make today.
Mom: Dad and I have to leave now, but you should cook your own breakfast!
Going hungry to a decision as big as this can’t be a good idea.
